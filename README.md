<h1> This is my Hello world html test </h1>
<h2> Here I will list the things I wish to learn (in no particular order) </h2>
<ul>
<li> HTML </li>
<li> CSS </li>
<li> Python </li>

<p> I have created this file to document my thoughts at the very beginning of my learning process.  <br/>
I also want to use this as a test bed for learning new coding languages. I also want to put my newly learned skills into practise.</p>
